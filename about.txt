Non official fan-service BL-HOTS

Unfortunately, support for our beloved game has nearly ceased. The game's reporting system is in a dire state,
and disruptive players are not being appropriately penalized. Therefore, I've developed a service to help you 
discern between friendly and hostile players. To help other players recognize the "most reliable" teammates, 
please submit a brief video and your nickname to us.


Hey everyone,
Sadly, our favorite game isn’t getting the support it deserves anymore. The reporting system is pretty much broken, and toxic players are running wild with no real consequences. That’s why I put together this service—to help you figure out who’s a solid teammate and who’s best avoided.

If you’ve got a clip showing an "awesome", "reliable" player, send it over along with their nickname. Let’s build a better community together!
